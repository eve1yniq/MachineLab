## Themes for the Clock

· Nature - volcano: I always have this fetish on volcanos. I've climbed three volcanos so far. And some volcanos have their own eruption - dormant cycles. I think it would be interesting if making a volcano.

· Color wheel: Inspired by my laptop desktop, I want to make a clock to reflect the change of the color of the sky in a day, from sunrise to sunset.

· Music : Using wooden structure and machinary to creat sounds or simulating nature sounds.
