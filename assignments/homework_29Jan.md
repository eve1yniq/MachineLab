## Themes for the Clock

· Nature - volcano: I always have this fetish on volcanos. I've climbed three volcanos so far. And some volcanos have their own eruption - dormant cycles. I think it would be interesting if making a volcano.

· Color wheel: Inspired by my laptop desktop, I want to make a clock to reflect the change of the color of the sky in a day, from sunrise to sunset.

· Music : Using wooden structure and machinary to creat sounds or simulating nature sounds.

The Halle de La Machine is a museum in the Montaudran suburb of Toulouse, France. There are lots of interesting machines , like the Bread Catapult, the Blackbird Pendulum, the Wine-Serving Machine or perhaps the Aerial Service with its Pepper Mill. Each machine tells a story and entertains through its movement and its identity.
