Continuing from last week, we tried the direct friction method. With the help of professor, we cut our platform into circular shape. 
We mounted the DC motor and the wheel and tire to the base. The motor was mounted in a bracket and then mounted to the frame on a hinge. Also, we added the slip ring to upple power to upper part of the carousel. We have taped the slip ring to the moving platform but wires dont get twisted. 

For the next step, we'll need to add a rubber band with appropritate tension to add some pressure. And then start working on the upper part with servo.

Here are some pics & videos 👇🏻

This is the slip ring:

This is how we mount the moter and how the hinge works:

This is how it looks like when the motor is moving:
