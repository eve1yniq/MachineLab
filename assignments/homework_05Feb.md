### 4. Volcano

#### Concept:
When the volcano is sleeping, everything is calm and peaceful. Only the smoke is flowing. When the volcano is waking up-it erupts, the lava will come out from the crater. 

#### Animation: 
1) lava_1: up and down / Light up and turn down
2) Smoke: rotating
3) lava_2: Light up and turn down

#### Sound: 
rumble sound: using wood+machinery? 

#### Materials:
1) Volcano: 3D printed
2) Lava: optical fiber
3) Smoke: cotton

#### Electrical and Mechanical Components:
Arduino, jumper wires, motors, LED lights
